## Router?

**Yes.**

Routers perform to select a path for traffic a network or across multiple networks.

So, we need the routers for using internet.

In fact, we already use routers normally. we already use home router(ex. ipTime) because of Wi-Fi.

Internet is consisted of many networks' connection.

So, there are many path to reach transmitter to receiver.

Here, selecting a correct path is ROUTING.

## Find IP

We should know Netflix server's IP to send packet from us to Netflix.

They already use domain(netflix.com), so we can find IP using DNS.

## Delivery

If we know server's IP, we can send packet to server.

They may use router, too. So, packet will send from our router to server's router using routing protocols.
